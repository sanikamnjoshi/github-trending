github-trending
===============

A python script that scrapes the GitHub trending page and writes the repo links to a text file.
Made using BeautifulSoup.
A separate text file is generated for each language each time the script is run.
Text files with links of repos with the same language lie in the same folder.

https://github.com/josephyzhou/github-trending.git has been used as an inspiration and guide for this.
